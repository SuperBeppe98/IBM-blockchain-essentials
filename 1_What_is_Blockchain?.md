Business networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.

One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.

The video in this module describes the business context of blockchain, the problems that blockchain can solve, what blockchain is and how it works.

Business networks, wealth and markets
• Business Networks benefit from connectivity
– Participants are customers, suppliers,
banks, partners
– Cross geography and regulatory boundary
• Wealth is generated by the flow of goods and
services across business network in transactions
and contracts
• Markets are central to this process:
– Public (fruit market, car auction), or
– Private (supply chain financing, bonds)

Transferring assets, building value
Anything that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value, is an asset
Two fundamental
types of asset
Intangible assets
subdivide
Cash is also
an asset
• Tangible, e.g. a house
• Intangible, e.g. a mortgage
• Financial, e.g. bond
• Intellectual, e.g. patents
• Digital, e.g. data
• Has property of anonymity

Ledgers, Transactions and Contracts
• Ledger: an important log of all transactions
– Describes the inputs and outputs of the
business
• Transaction: an asset transfer between participants
– Matt gives a car to Dave (simple)
• Contract: the conditions for a transaction to occur
– If Dave pays Matt money, then car passes from
Matt to Dave (simple)
– If car won't start, funds do not pass to Matt (as
decided by third party arbitrator) (more
complex)

Requirements of blockchain for business
Participants
decide which
assets to share
ASSETS
Participants know
who they are
dealing with;
information shared
is need-to-know
IDENTITY
Participants give
provable
endorsement
