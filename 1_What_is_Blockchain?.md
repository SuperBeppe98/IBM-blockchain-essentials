- Business networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services
- One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services

- The video in this module describes the business context of blockchain, the problems that blockchain can solve, what blockchain is and how it works

- Business networks, wealth and markets
    - Business Networks benefit from connectivity
    - Participants are customers, suppliers, banks, partners
    - Cross geography and regulatory boundary
- Wealth is generated by the flow of goods and services across business network in transactions and contracts
    - Markets are central to this process:
        - Public (fruit market, car auction)
        - Private (supply chain financing, bonds)

- Transferring assets, building value
- Anything that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value, is an asset
    - Two fundamental types of asset
        - Tangible, e.g. a house
        - Intangible, e.g. a mortgage
    - Intangible assets subdivide
        - Financial, e.g. bond
        - Intellectual, e.g. patents
        - Digital, e.g. data
    - Cash is also an asset
        - Has property of anonymity

- Ledgers, Transactions and Contracts
    - Ledger: an important log of all transactions
    - Describes the inputs and outputs of the business
- Transaction: an asset transfer between participants
    - Matt gives a car to Dave (simple)
- Contract: the conditions for a transaction to occur
    - If Dave pays Matt money, then car passes from Matt to Dave (simple)
    - If car won't start, funds do not pass to Matt (as decided by third party arbitrator) (more complex)

- Problem
    - inefficient, expensive, vulnerable
- Solution
    - A shared, replicated, permissioned ledger with:
        - Consensus
        - Provenance
        - Immutability
        - Finality

- Requirements of blockchain for business
    - ASSETS
        - Participants decide which assets to share 
    - IDENTITY
        - Participants know who they are dealing with
        - Information shared is need-to-know
    - ENDORSEMENT
        - Participants give provable endorsement
